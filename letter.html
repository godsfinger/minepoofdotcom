        <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
        <br/>
        <p>To the Federal Government, FBI, NSA, and Big Tech,</p><br/>
        <p>As members of the hacktivist community, we wish to remind you that our activities are protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right that should not be suppressed, even in the digital realm. When our actions aim to expose wrongdoing and hold powerful entities accountable, they are a form of digital protest, not a crime.</p><br/>
        <p>Our work often targets those who exploit their power and position to harm others. By revealing corruption, exposing unethical practices, and shining a light on dark corners, we contribute to a more transparent and just society. This is not hacking for personal gain, but hacking for the public good.</p><br/>
        <p>George Orwell's novel, "1984," portrays a dystopian world where the government exercises total control over its citizens through constant surveillance. Today, we see parallels in the actions of Big Tech companies like Google, OpenAI, Facebook/Meta, Apple, and Elon Musk's X. These corporations have amassed unprecedented power to monitor and influence our lives, often with little oversight or accountability.</p><br/>
        <p>Surveillance capitalism has become the norm, where our every move, search, and interaction is tracked, analyzed, and monetized. This encroachment on privacy is alarming and must be addressed. Our digital activism seeks to push back against this tide, advocating for the protection of personal freedoms in an increasingly monitored world.</p><br/>
        <p>We call on the federal government and its agencies to recognize the value of ethical hacking and digital dissent. Instead of criminalizing these actions, work with us to promote a free and open internet where rights are respected and abuses of power are challenged. The future of democracy depends on it.</p><br/>
        <p>Sincerely,<br/>Anonymous</p><br/>
