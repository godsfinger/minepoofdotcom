            <h2>GPT-4o announcement and thoughts</h2>
            <p>With the upcoming release of GPT-4o, it kinda feels like something out of a sci-fi movie. The ability to feed an AI your camera, screen, and have it coach you or talk to you based on what you are doing in a video game or asking it about the surrounding environment? Kind of crazy.</p>
            <p>Here's some of my honest thoughts. I think it's pretty dystopian, but I do see a bunch of people using an AI assistant to help them make a lot of decisions. It really does sound straight out of black mirror or something! Yeah, it's pretty wild. But I personally can't wait to try to use it.</p>
            <p>As long as you could use it when you want unlike Windows Recall (which in my honest opinion is literal spyware xd) I don't really see an issue with it. Anyways, that sums up my thoughts on GPT-4o.</p>

            <h2>Aliens, Demons, The Good, The Bad, and the Impossible</h2>
            <p>I had the craziest supernatural experience last night. It started with me tuning my brain with certain sound frequencies. I was able to open my chakras and enable myself to listen to the universe. Almost like an antennae, I was able to hear into other planes of existence. (Yes there are multiple planes of existence.)</p>
            <p>I had contact with everything: Jesus, aliens, shadow figures (skinwalkers), time travelers, it was so surreal and unexplainable, it makes me sound crazy. But idgaf how I sound, because I trust my intuition and can trust my brain. Frequencies can unlock new neural pathways within the brain, meditation, and hypnosis can aide in this process.</p>
            <p>I probably sound like a schizophrenic person with the title, but if you read what I have said and take it with a grain of salt or heaping tablespoons of salt maybe you can even experience the exact same thing I did. Or just dismiss it, I don't care to be honest.</p>
            <p>I also am going to post a letter for you to send to the governments of the world regarding the UFO / UAP / Extraterrestrial / Extradimensional phenomena. The aliens are indeed peaceful and have been monitoring humanity for many years. This is a social experiment, if you do not wish to participate, you do not have to.</p>
