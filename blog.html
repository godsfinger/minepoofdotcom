            <h2>Windows introduces personal spying!</h2>
            <p>You just can't make this shit up! Like some blackmirror shit! We all knew that Microsoft Windows was already being used for spying by big tech and big brother, but now they are just shoving it in your face, LITERALLY! LMFAO! You can't make this up.</p>
            <p>Now Microsoft Windows is introducing a new tool for Windows 11 called "Recall" which basically screen records your PC 24/7 and you could recall shit from previous applications / search history on your computer. Yeah, totally not creepy at all! /s</p>
            <p>Like even if they say it's "stored on your device" as they say, you don't find that a little creepy? Yeah man, I'm currently dual booting Windows 11 and arch linux, but if they make this a mandatory, untoggleable feature, I will completely uninstall Windows 11 and JUST use arch linux. Either that or use my Screen recording AI spyware and train it's algorithms on a shit ton of gay porn LOL.  I don't even like Windows 11, I only use it to play rainbow six siege since the ubisoft devs don't want to port it to linux.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, this is another awful move by Microsoft to look even more creepy stalker than they already are. Maybe this is the year of the Linux Desktop. Or in 2025 when windows 10 support fades out or whatever. We'll see, but hey at least they are open that they are spying on you now! :)</p>

            <h2>Artificial intelligence and the future.</h2>
            <p>Artificial intelligence has been gaining a lot of popularity as of late, and I wouldn't be suprised to see an Artificial General Intelligence God by 2027. It's getting so good it's genuinely starting to make me feel like I'm in a blackmirror episode. The scariest part is, this isn't even the end, it's the beginning. </p>
            <p>With robots being developed by Boston Dynamics, Figura, and Tesla, and OpenAI building these insane LLM's, it's beginning to feel a lot like a cyber-dystopia. I'm personally not scared of AI, but have a feeling within 5 years or so, the amount of technological advancements that will be made is going to scare a lot of people.</p>
            <p>From brainchips, to being able to cure diseases, and a lot more, not to mention robots taking over everybodies job. Like, what the fuck are we going to do then? Just work in more creative fields? It's fucking bananas. In 10 years we'll probably look back and be like wtf happened. I feel blessed and also worried that I am born in such a time as now.</p>

            <h2>Blackmail is the best form of hostage.</h2>
            <p>Imagine ransomware, that blackmails the victim to do something. Not asking for a payment, but rather something the victim has to do to gain back their files. Well, actually you don't have to imagine this, it's already possible. But people are just too nieve and only care about money. Sure, it's great to get money, but it's also great to blackmail people who deserve to be blackmailed. An example could be a pedophile, and blackmail them to record a video of themself eating shit. Or dressing up in a clown costume. Giving them a sense of false hope, then telling all of their loved ones that they like to diddle kids.</p>
            <p>Then of course making a report to the police and feds about where they live, plus all the chatlogs / evidence you have on them. CSE or child sexual exploitation is a horrible thing, no child deserves to be harmed, EVER. Sickos like that deserve to be killed in prison, or in my honest opinion tortured, either by being covered in gasoline and lit on fire, or something similar. Blackmail is indeed the best form of hostage. If you have blackmail on somebody, you can make them do anything.</p>
            <p>I honestly wouldn't be suprised if the majority of hollywood stars and government officials have blackmail of them with kids especially after the P. Diddy stuff has been surfacing, along with Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, etc.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, coding malware or ransomware that blackmails bad people shouldn't even be illegal in my honest opinion, since those people deserve it. Not saying that hacking big corporations or hospitals is okay, because it's not, but certain people deserve to be hacked. Especially people who you know are evil to the core.</p>
